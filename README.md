# frontend-wakelock-poc

This is a small proof of concept for the flamenco issue [#99436](https://projects.blender.org/studio/flamenco/issues/99436). It acquires wake lock by playing a hidden video on loop.

Set your computer screen saver to 1 minute or less and click the checkbox button. It should not allow your screen to go blank.
